# fast-dct
This project is about a novel potential implementation of fast DCT.
The project is implemented in VB.net and has three versions of DCT:
1. Traditional 8x8 DCT
2. Fast 8x8 DCT implemented in two phases, each phase implement one dimension DCT (raw by raw one dimension DCT, then column by column one dimension DCT)
3. Novel super fast 8x8 DCT (based on new mathematical derivation)

The code provides powerful interafce to load and transform BMP images
